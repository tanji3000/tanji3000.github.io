## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# rm(df1, df2, id, name)
id <- (1:5)
name <- c("Jung", "Lee", "Kim","Hwang","Hong")
df1 <- data.frame(id, name)

id <- (1:4)
name <- c("Jung", "Kim","Hwang","Hong")
df2 <- data.frame(id, name)

df1$check = ifelse(df1$name %in% df2$name, "OK", "NA")
```
